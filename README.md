# Code-Refactory-Challenge
I have been tasked to modify the code and the css of a mock digital marketing company in order to fit best practice accessibility.
I also removed duplicate css instructions and made it easier to read. 
I fixed the broken links and made sure heading followed the correct numerical order.
