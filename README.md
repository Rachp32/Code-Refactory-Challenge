# Code-Refactory-Challenge
I have been tasked to modify the code and the css of a mock digital marketing company in order to fit best practice accessibility.
I also removed duplicate css instructions and made it easier to read. 
I fixed the broken links and made sure heading followed the correct numerical order.
The task instructed me to use semantic html elements in order to improve the codes readability.To the best of my ability i have made the html elements follow a logical structure.
The heading attributes follow sequential order and the title element now contains a concise descriptive title.
